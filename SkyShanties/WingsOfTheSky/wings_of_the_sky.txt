Bound for the heavens wide and high,
steel wings soar, touch the sky.
Through clouds we glide and smile.

Over horizons dreams ascend,
steel feathers catching sun.
Through storms we press so brave.

Raise your voices, spirits take flight (raise your voices).
Captains of air day and night (raise them to the sky).
Raise your voices, spirits take flight (raise your voices).
Raise them to the sky.
