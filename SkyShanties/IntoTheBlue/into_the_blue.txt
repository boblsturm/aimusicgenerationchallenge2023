Into the blue, we venture each day,
Through the wild open yonder, where the skies meet the gray.
With courage and grace, we'll reach for the sun,
In the cockpit we trust, for our journey's begun.

Into the blue, through the turbulence and light,
We'll navigate boldly, in the day and the night.
With passengers' dreams and their fears set aside,
Into the blue, with the wind as our guide.

From the cityscapes below, to the stars shining bright,
Through the canvas of clouds, we'll take flight after flight.
With our wings in the wind, we'll forever abide,
Into the blue, on this journey we ride.
