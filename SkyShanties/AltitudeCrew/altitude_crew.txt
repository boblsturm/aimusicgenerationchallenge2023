We're altitude crew in the blue expanse,
cockpit to cabin, side by side.
Uniform attire, serving with a smile.

From takeoff to landing, mile after mile.
We're a family through the sky.
Through delays and struggles,
we'll always abide.

Altitude crew (soaring through the sky),
together we soar (making loved ones prowd).
We're altitude crew.
