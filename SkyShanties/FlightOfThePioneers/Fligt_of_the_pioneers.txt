Down in the fields where the wild winds blow
There's a melody, the aviators know (ooh-yeah)
In their hearts they hear the call
Of the flight that's bound to rise and fall (oh-oh)
With every step, they pave the way

Oh, the Flight of the Pioneers (pioneers)
Guided by the rhythm in their ears (in their ears)
Their boots stompin', hearts thumpin' (thumpin')
As they soar, into the unknown (unknown)
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh (oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh (oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
