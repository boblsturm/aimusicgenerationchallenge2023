In the cockpit we gather, with precision in sight,
Clear skies ahead, as we climb to the light.
Safety our watchword, we trust in our crew,
Through every maneuver, we'll see this thing through.

Clear skies ahead, on our aviation quest,
Guiding us safely, to our ultimate rest.
With each flight, we're tested, and we'll rise to the test,
Clear skies ahead, we'll give it our best.

Instruments humming, we navigate true,
Through rain, wind, and thunder, we'll conquer and do.
With eyes on the horizon, and teamwork our guide,
Clear skies ahead, on this journey we ride.
