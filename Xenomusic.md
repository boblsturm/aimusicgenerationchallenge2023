# The Ai Music Generation Challenge 2023 Submission: Xenomusic

Nick Collins, Durham University, UK

> To imagine a more distant alien music worthy of strange new worlds, the foundations of music as a time-based art form can be abstracted in a new way. Unfamiliar exoplanets and unknown xenobiology may lead to music transmitted in the vibrations of strange elements and materials, intended for different auditory conditions and physiological apparatus, even at different cognitive rates, all impacting on the perceptibility to human ears of xenomusical information.

Submission consists of:

1. Xenophone music generator: creates music using a model of time and frequency content based in shorter or longer spans of working memory than a human;
2. Xenotext generator: creates 'written' documentation of the Xenomusaical tradition in an abstracted alien language (translated to ASCII)
