# The Ai Music Generation Challenge 2023 Submission: Sky Shanties

Laura Cros Vila, KTH, Stockholm Sweden

> A tradition emerged in the 21st century bearing a striking resemblance to the sea shanties of old. These modern anthems, often referred to as sky shanties, serve as a source of camaraderie and inspiration for those working in skyward ships â€“ whether they be pilots, flight attendants, air traffic controllers, or aviation enthusiasts. As sea shanties helped sailors coordinate their maneuvers and pass the time during long voyages at sea, sky shanties serve a similar purpose but during long voyages in air.
