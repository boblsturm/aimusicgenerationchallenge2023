# The Ai Music Generation Challenge 2023 Submission: Scrap Metal (The lost sound of the 90s)

> Scrap Metal is described as a 90s musical style inspired by plunderphonics and metal, and observed through the compensatory memory lens of internet dwellers of the last decade. According to the fragments we've uncovered, Scrap Metal was created in the early 90s by the drummer Chester Navidson reacting against the increasing technicality and abstraction of heavy metal at the time.

> There are three steps to creating scrap metal:
> 1. Gather scrap: Guests provide material (scrap) they want to appear in some way (like a bunch of songs). Guests don't know what other guests have provided.
> 2. Prepare yard: Band composes a backing track using the scrap however they want, taking elements like a riff, a rhythm, a chord progression, etc. This becomes the Yard.
> 3. Play: Guests discover the Yard on the fly improvising with the band, focusing on spontaneity and interaction.

> Important rule: *Stay Metal*
