# The Ai Music Generation Challenge 2023

Unlike the previous three editions ([2020](https://boblsturm.github.io/aimusic2020/), [2021](https://github.com/boblsturm/aimusicgenerationchallenge2021), [2022](https://github.com/boblsturm/aimusicgenerationchallenge2022)), this challenge is focused not on generating a particular form of existing traditional music, but instead on generating an /artificial music tradition/.

## What is the challenge?

Use any kind of artificial intelligence (one system or many different systems) in any way to generate an artificial music tradition. This could entail symbolic music, audio recordings, lyrics, dances, imagery, costumes, myths, instruments, ephemra, websites, ethnomusicological or anthropological studies, and so on. 

## How?
1. By JULY 4, register your intent to participate by notifying the [organizer](mailto:bobs@kth.se?subject=Participation-in-the-Ai-Music-Generation-Challenge-2023).
2. Start generating documentary evidence of your artificial music tradition.
3. Write a brief technical document describing your technical process.
4. By OCTOBER 6, email the [organizer](mailto:bobs@kth.se):
- a link to download the documentary evidence of your artificial music tradition.
- a link to download your technical document (pdf).

## Evaluation
The evaluation of submitted artificial music traditions will proceed in the following way:
1. TBA

## Why?
This challenge has three aims:
1. to promote meaningful approaches to evaluating music Ai;
2. to see how music Ai research can benefit from traditional music, and how traditional music can benefit from music Ai research;
3. to facilitate discussions about the ethics of music Ai research applied to traditional music practices.
