# The Ai Music Generation Challenge 2023

Unlike the previous three editions ([2020](https://boblsturm.github.io/aimusic2020/), [2021](https://github.com/boblsturm/aimusicgenerationchallenge2021) [2022](https://github.com/boblsturm/aimusicgenerationchallenge2022)), this challenge is focused not on generating a particular form of existing traditional music, but instead on generating an /artificial music tradition/.

## What is the challenge?

Use any kind of artificial intelligence (one system or many different systems) in any way to generate an artificial music tradition. This could entail symbolic music, audio recordings, lyrics, dances, imagery, costumes, myths, instruments, ephemra, websites, ethnomusicological or anthropological studies, and so on. 

## How?
1. By JULY 4, register your intent to participate by notifying the [organizer](mailto:bobs@kth.se?subject=Participation-in-the-Ai-Music-Generation-Challenge-2023).
2. Start generating documentary evidence of your artificial music tradition.
3. Write a brief technical document describing your technical process.
4. By OCTOBER 6, email the [organizer](mailto:bobs@kth.se):
- a link to download the documentary evidence of your artificial music tradition.
- a link to download your technical document (pdf).
5. If you are appraising or titling tunes, you will receive a set of tunes from the submitted collections sometime after OCTOBER 7.

## Tune Evaluation
The evaluation of submitted tune collections will proceed in the following way:
1. From each submitted collection, one tune is selected by the participant of the collection, and a number of others are selected at random.
3. All selected tunes are sent to all judges for review.
4. _Stage 1_ Each judge reviews the acceptability of each tune according to the following:
- If plagiarism detected, reject and do not review.
- If rhythm is not characteristic of a reel, reject and do not review.
- If mode and accidentals are not characteristic of a reel, reject and do not review.
5. _Stage 2_ Each judge will rate on a scale of 1–5 the acceptable tunes along the following qualities:
- Structure
- Melody
6. _Stage 3_ Each judge will present to the other judges the best tunes from their collections, and together will decide which are the best reel (or to award no prize).

## Artificial Judge Evaluation
The evaluation of artificial judges will proceed in the following way:
1. Each artificial judge will perform the first two stages of evaluation for a selection of submitted tunes.
- Stage 1: rejection based on plagiarism, rhythm and mode/accidentals.
- Stage 2: scoring of the remaining tunes along structure and melody (graded on a scale 1, 2, 3, 4, 5) where 1 is poor.
2. The ranking of the artificial judges will be done by the organizers by comparing AI judge outputs with those of the real judges in each stage. 
3. To measure the differences between real and AI judges in stage 1 we will count coincident rejections of all judges.
4. To measure the differences between real and AI judges in stage 2, we will compute a mean minimum magnitude difference of scores for non-rejected tunes. 
5. There will be baseline computational judges, such as “reject all”, “score all as 3”, and "randomly reject or score”.

## Title Evaluation
The evaluation of tune-titling systems will proceed in the following way:
1. Each tune titler will title a selection of submitted tunes.
2. Titles of tunes achieving high scores in Stage 2 will be submitted to human judges for ranking.
3. Highest ranked titles will be awarded prizes.

## Why?
This challenge has three aims:
1. to promote meaningful approaches to evaluating music Ai;
2. to see how music Ai research can benefit from traditional music, and how traditional music can benefit from music Ai research;
3. to facilitate discussions about the ethics of music Ai research applied to traditional music practices.

## Frequently Asked Questions
1. "Where can I get data?" The 350 reels in O'Neill's 1001 are tunes 456-805 available [here](http://john-chambers.us/~jc/music/book/ONeills/1001/).
2. "How is this challenge funded?" The 2022 challenge is part of a project that has received funding from the European Research Council (ERC) under the European Union’s Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme (Grant agreement No. 864189 [MUSAiC: Music at the Frontiers of Artificial Creativity and Criticism](https://www.kth.se/is/tmh/speech-communication/musaic-music-at-the-frontiers-of-artificial-creativity-and-criticism-1.950539)).
